# XML_Project
In this project, I have used XML to store and output data. XML is an extensible markup language that can be used to describe and transmit various types of data.
To parse and manipulate XML data, I have used the Document Object Model (DOM). DOM is an API for programming that parses XML data into a tree structure consisting of nodes and attributes. 
Then, by manipulating these nodes and attributes, the XML data can be edited and queried.
To implement data input and output, I have used HTTP requests to download the XML file from GitHub. This makes the project more flexible and allows for easy updating and sharing of data.
